Each module is assigned a unique Modbus address via WebConfig, supporting up to 32 devices per bus.

**Default communication parameters:**  
- **Address:** 1  
- **Baud rate:** 19200 bps  
- **Format:** 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)  
- **Termination:** 120 Œ© enabled at end of bus  
- **Fail-safe:** retains last valid PWM and relay state if communication is lost  

The controller periodically polls holding registers to:  
- Write PWM duty values for R, G, B, CW, WW channels  
- Control the relay output  
- Read digital input and status bits  

WebConfig enables users to modify address, baud rate, test I/O, calibrate channels, and perform real-time diagnostics ‚Äî simplifying setup and commissioning.

# 3. Use Cases

The **RGB-621-R1** module is primarily designed for multi-channel lighting control but can also be used in broader automation and signaling tasks.  
Its combination of isolated inputs, PWM outputs, and a relay makes it suitable for ambient lighting, architectural control, and user-interactive automation.

---

### üè† Use Case 1 ‚Äî RGB Scene Control with Wall Switch Inputs

**Purpose:**  
Use two wall switches to trigger and cycle through preset color or brightness scenes stored in the controller.

**How it works:**  
Each digital input acts as a trigger to change the lighting mode or adjust brightness levels.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Connect **DI1** and **DI2** to wall switches (dry contact).  
2. Wire **RGBW LED strips** to PWM outputs R, G, B, CW, WW.  
3. In **WebConfig**, assign Modbus address and test LED channels.  
4. In the **MicroPLC / MiniPLC**, define scene logic (e.g., DI1 ‚Üí next scene, DI2 ‚Üí off).  
5. Use Modbus holding registers to control PWM duty cycles for each channel.

---

### üí° Use Case 2 ‚Äî Relay-Based Power Switching for LED Drivers

**Purpose:**  
Control a 24 V LED power supply or auxiliary lighting circuit via the onboard relay.

**How it works:**  
The relay output switches the driver‚Äôs DC line or AC supply based on PLC logic or local input triggers.

**Setup Steps:**

2. Wire LED outputs to PWM channels for dimming control.  
3. In **WebConfig**, enable relay control via Modbus coil.  
4. Program the controller to energize the relay only when active scenes are running.  
5. Optionally, use a wall switch on **DI1** as a manual override for relay control.

---

### üåà Use Case 3 ‚Äî Tunable White (CCT) Control with Daylight Automation

**Purpose:**  
Implement human-centric lighting that adjusts color temperature (CCT) throughout the day.

**How it works:**  
Two PWM channels (CW and WW) mix warm and cool light based on time of day or ambient sensor input.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Connect **CW** and **WW** LED strips to respective PWM outputs.  
2. Define a time-based profile in the controller (morning = warm, midday = cool).  
3. Use Modbus registers to update CW/WW duty cycles automatically.  
4. Optionally, map DI1 as a manual ‚ÄúDay/Night‚Äù mode toggle.  
5. Adjust max/min PWM limits in WebConfig for consistent brightness.

---

### üö® Use Case 4 ‚Äî Status Indicator / Alarm Signaling

**Purpose:**  
Display system or alarm status using color lighting patterns.

**How it works:**  
The module‚Äôs PWM channels can drive RGB indicators or stack lights controlled by alarm flags from the PLC.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Wire a small 12 V RGB LED indicator to PWM outputs R, G, and B.  
2. Connect the module to the same Modbus bus as the alarm controller.  
3. Assign registers to display alarm colors (e.g., red = alert, green = normal).  
4. Use DI1 as a manual alarm acknowledge input.  
5. Configure the relay as an auxiliary siren or warning signal driver.

---

### üß† Use Case 5 ‚Äî Standalone Mood Lighting Controller

**Purpose:**  
Operate ambient RGB lighting locally without an external PLC, using onboard inputs and preloaded logic.

**How it works:**  
The module can store simple input-to-output mapping rules (through WebConfig or firmware) for local lighting control.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Power the module from a 24 V DC supply.  
2. Connect LED strips to PWM outputs and wall switches to DI1/DI2.  
3. In WebConfig, set input-to-PWM mapping rules or fading behavior.  
4. Adjust brightness levels and transition speeds.  
5. Optionally, connect to Modbus later for centralized control or monitoring.

---

These examples illustrate how the **RGB-621-R1** can serve as both a **dedicated lighting driver** and a **multi-purpose automation node**, combining smooth dimming, robust field isolation, and Modbus integration.

# 4. Safety Information

## 4.1 General Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Qualified Personnel** | Installation, wiring, and servicing must be performed by trained technicians familiar with 24 V DC SELV/PELV control systems. |
| **Power Isolation** | Always disconnect the 24 V DC supply and RS-485 network before wiring or servicing. |
| **Rated Voltages Only** | Operate only from a **Safety Extra-Low Voltage (SELV/PELV) 24 V DC** source. **12 V DC is not supported.** Never connect mains (230 V AC) to any terminal. |
| **Independent Power** | Each controller and I/O module must have its **own 24 V DC power supply**, sized for its load and fused appropriately. |
| **Grounding** | Ensure proper protective-earth (PE) connection of the control cabinet and shielded bus cable. |
| **Enclosure** | Mount the device on a DIN rail inside a dry, clean enclosure. Avoid condensation, dust, or corrosive atmosphere. |

---

## 4.2 Installation Practices

**DIN-Rail Mounting**  
- Mount on a **35 mm DIN rail (EN 60715)**.  
- Provide at least **10 mm** clearance above/below for airflow and terminal access.  
- Route LED-power wiring separately from communication lines.

**Electrical Domains**  
Two distinct domains exist:  

- **Field Power (24 V DC)** ‚Äî supplies LED drivers, relay, and input circuits.  
- **Logic Power (5 V / 3.3 V)** ‚Äî internal regulation for MCU, USB, and RS-485.  

The field return is **`GND_FUSED`**; the logic return is **`GND`**.  
üü° **Important:** Do **not** externally bridge `GND_FUSED` and `GND`.  
Isolation between these domains is provided internally through the ISO1212 and SFH6156 devices.

**LED Power and Output Wiring**  
- The LED power rail (+24 V) enters through the protected input (fuses F3/F4, diode D5 STPS340U, surge D6 SMBJ33A).  
- It passes the relay K1 (HF115F) and feeds the **COM (+24 V)** terminal on the bottom connector.  
- LED channel outputs (**R, G, B, CW, WW**) are **low-side PWM sinks** using **AP9990GH-HF MOSFETs**.  
- Connect **LED +** to **COM**, and each color cathode to its respective channel output.  
- Only **24 V LED strips** (common-anode type) are supported.

**Relay Wiring**  
- Type HF115F (5 V coil, SPST-NO).  
- Contact rating: 16 A @ 250 VAC / 30 V DC (resistive).  
- For inductive loads, add an **external flyback diode or RC snubber**.  
- Keep relay conductors away from signal wiring.

**Digital Input Wiring**  
- Inputs use **ISO1212 galvanic isolation**.  
- Connect **dry contacts** or **24 V DC sourcing sensors** only.  
- Each input path has a **PTC fuse (F5/F6)**, **TVS D9**, and **reverse diodes (D10‚ÄìD14)**.  
- Do not inject external voltage into DI pins.  
- Use shielded twisted-pair cable for runs > 10 m.

  Connect the **+24 V** and **0 V (GND)** to the top power terminals marked **V+** and **0V** or **LED PS**.

- The LED strip‚Äôs positive rail (**+24 V**) is routed internally through:
  - **PTC fuses (F3/F4)** for over-current protection  
  - **Reverse-polarity diode (STPS340U)**  
  - **Surge suppressor (SMBJ33A)**  
  - **Relay K1 (HF115F)**, which switches the LED power output (COM terminal)  

  The LED channels (R/G/B/CW/WW) act as **low-side PWM sinks**, and the LED strip must be **24 V common-anode**.

- **Current consumption (typical):**
  - Logic + RS-485: ‚âà 100 mA  
  - Relay coil: ‚âà 30 mA (active)  
  - LED load: dependent on connected strips (sized per external 24 V LED PSU)

- **Ground references:**  
  - `GND_FUSED` ‚Üí field ground for LED and inputs  
  - `GND` ‚Üí logic/USB ground  
  These are internally isolated ‚Äî do **not** tie them together externally.

| **B** | RS-485 B (‚Äì) | Inverting line |
| **COM** | Common reference (optional) | Field ground reference (GND_FUSED) for long bus runs |

- Use a **twisted-pair shielded cable** (e.g., Cat-5 or RS-485 grade).  
  Connect the shield to protective earth (PE) at **one end only**.

- **Network topology:**  
  Daisy-chain (bus) ‚Äî no star wiring.  
  Enable the 120 Œ© termination resistor **only** at the last module in the chain.

- **Default Modbus settings:**  
  - **Address:** 1  
  - **Baud rate:** 19200 bps  
  - **Data format:** 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (**8N1**)  

- **Configuration:**  
  - Connect via **USB-C** and open **WebConfig** in a Chromium-based browser.  
  - Set module address, baud rate, and optional relay/input parameters.  
  - Save settings to non-volatile memory.  

- **Ground reference use:**  
  - In most RS-485 systems, differential A/B are sufficient.  
  - The **COM** terminal may be connected between devices only if bus transceivers require a shared reference (rare in modern isolated networks).

  Confirm Modbus control vs. local override mode, verify coil/state in WebConfig, and ensure external wiring is on **C/NO** (dry contact). Add snubber for inductive loads.
- **LED channels do not light:**  
  Verify **COM (+24 V)** to strip, channel cathodes on **R/G/B/CW/WW**, correct polarity, and adequate 24 V PSU sizing.
- **Inputs not detected:**  
  Use **DI 24Vdc** terminals (I1/I2 with GND). Confirm sensor type (dry contact or 24 V sourcing) and debounce/invert settings in WebConfig.
- **USB not detected:**  
  Use a data-capable USB-C cable; close any app holding the port; re-enter **BOOT** (1+2).
