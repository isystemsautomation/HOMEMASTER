## 1.3 System Role & Communication

The **RGB-621-R1** operates as a **Modbus RTU slave** on an **RS-485 differential bus**, typically polled by a **HomeMaster controller** (MicroPLC / MiniPLC) or other Modbus master.  
Each module is assigned a unique Modbus address via WebConfig, supporting up to 32 devices per bus.

**Default communication parameters:**  
- **Address:** 1  
- **Baud rate:** 19200 bps  
- **Format:** 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)  
- **Termination:** 120 Œ© enabled at end of bus  
- **Fail-safe:** retains last valid PWM and relay state if communication is lost  

The controller periodically polls holding registers to:  
- Write PWM duty values for R, G, B, CW, WW channels  
- Control the relay output  
- Read digital input and status bits  

WebConfig enables users to modify address, baud rate, test I/O, calibrate channels, and perform real-time diagnostics ‚Äî simplifying setup and commissioning.

# 3. Safety Information

## 3.1 General Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Qualified Personnel** | Installation, wiring, and servicing must be performed by trained technicians familiar with 24 V DC SELV/PELV control systems. |
| **Power Isolation** | Always disconnect the 24 V DC supply and RS-485 network before wiring or servicing. |
| **Rated Voltages Only** | Operate only from a **Safety Extra-Low Voltage (SELV/PELV) 24 V DC** source. **12 V DC is not supported.** Never connect mains (230 V AC) to any terminal. |
| **Independent Power** | Each controller and I/O module must have its **own 24 V DC power supply**, sized for its load and fused appropriately. |
| **Grounding** | Ensure proper protective-earth (PE) connection of the control cabinet and shielded bus cable. |
| **Enclosure** | Mount the device on a DIN rail inside a dry, clean enclosure. Avoid condensation, dust, or corrosive atmosphere. |

---

## 3.2 Installation Practices

**DIN-Rail Mounting**  
- Mount on a **35 mm DIN rail (EN 60715)**.  
- Provide at least **10 mm** clearance above/below for airflow and terminal access.  
- Route LED-power wiring separately from communication lines.

**Electrical Domains**  
Two distinct domains exist:  

- **Field Power (24 V DC)** ‚Äî supplies LED drivers, relay, and input circuits.  
- **Logic Power (5 V / 3.3 V)** ‚Äî internal regulation for MCU, USB, and RS-485.  

The field return is **`GND_FUSED`**; the logic return is **`GND`**.  
üü° **Important:** Do **not** externally bridge `GND_FUSED` and `GND`.  
Isolation between these domains is provided internally through the ISO1212 and SFH6156 devices.

**LED Power and Output Wiring**  
- The LED power rail (+24 V) enters through the protected input (fuses F3/F4, diode D5 STPS340U, surge D6 SMBJ33A).  
- It passes the relay K1 (HF115F) and feeds the **COM (+24 V)** terminal on the bottom connector.  
- LED channel outputs (**R, G, B, CW, WW**) are **low-side PWM sinks** using **AP9990GH-HF MOSFETs**.  
- Connect **LED +** to **COM**, and each color cathode to its respective channel output.  
- Only **24 V LED strips** (common-anode type) are supported.

**Relay Wiring**  
- Type HF115F (5 V coil, SPST-NO).  
- Contact rating: 16 A @ 250 VAC / 30 V DC (resistive).  
- For inductive loads, add an **external flyback diode or RC snubber**.  
- Keep relay conductors away from signal wiring.

**Digital Input Wiring**  
- Inputs use **ISO1212 galvanic isolation**.  
- Connect **dry contacts** or **24 V DC sourcing sensors** only.  
- Each input path has a **PTC fuse (F5/F6)**, **TVS D9**, and **reverse diodes (D10‚ÄìD14)**.  
- Do not inject external voltage into DI pins.  
- Use shielded twisted-pair cable for runs > 10 m.
