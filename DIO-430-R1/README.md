# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview of the DIO-430-R1

The **DIO-430-R1** is a smart digital I/O module designed for integration into modular automation systems. It offers **4 opto-isolated digital inputs**, **3 high-current SPDT relays**, **3 user buttons**, and **3 configurable user LEDs**. All I/O channels are individually configurable, enabling flexible behavior such as toggle, pulse, manual override, and alarm indication.

It integrates seamlessly with **HomeMaster MicroPLC and MiniPLC**, as well as **Home Assistant via ESPHome**, **PLC/SCADA systems** via **Modbus RTU (RS-485)**, and supports standalone operation with local logic. Configuration is handled through a driverless **Web Serial interface via USB‚ÄëC**, using a browser-based **WebConfig Tool**.  
Its primary role is to provide reliable relay control and digital input monitoring for building automation, alarms, lighting, and other general-purpose control systems.

# 3. Safety Information

These guidelines apply to the DIO-430-R1 I/O module. Ignoring them may result in equipment damage, system failure, or personal injury.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **SELV Domains Only**  
> This device uses **SELV/PELV** domains (e.g., 24 V DC, RS-485, USB). **Do not** connect any mains voltage to any terminal.  
> Respect isolation: never bridge logic GND with isolated field grounds (e.g., GND_ISO/FGND).

---

## 3.1 General Requirements

| Requirement          | Detail |
|---------------------|--------|
| Qualified Personnel | Installation and servicing must be done by qualified personnel familiar with 24 V control systems and RS-485. |
| Power Isolation     | Disconnect the **24 V DC** input before wiring. Lockout/tagout where applicable. |
| Environmental Limits| Mount in a clean, sealed enclosure; avoid condensation, conductive dust, or vibration. |
| Grounding           | Bond the panel to PE. Keep RS-485 COM/GND shared with the controller side. |
| Voltage Compliance  | **SELV only** on all terminals. Follow relay contact ratings on the product label/datasheet. Use upstream fusing and surge protection. |

---

## 3.2 Installation Practices

| Task              | Guidance |
|-------------------|----------|
| ESD Protection    | Handle by the enclosure/edge only. Use an antistatic wrist strap when the board is exposed. |
| DIN Rail Mounting | Mount securely on **35 mm DIN** rail inside an IP-rated cabinet. Leave cable slack for strain relief. |
| Wiring            | Use correct wire gauge and torque terminal screws. Separate **power**, **DI**, **relay**, and **RS-485** harnesses. |
| Isolation Domains | Respect isolation: **do not bridge** logic **GND** to isolated field grounds (e.g., **GND_ISO/FGND**). Keep analog/sensor returns on the isolated side. |
| Commissioning     | Before power-up, verify polarity, relay NO/NC routing, RS-485 **A/B** orientation and termination. |

---

## 3.3 I/O & Interface Warnings

### üîå Power

| Area         | Warning |
|--------------|---------|
| 24 V DC Input| Use a clean, fused SELV supply. Reverse-polarity protection exists but may disable the module when triggered. |
| Sensor Rail  | Power sensors from a SELV rail. Observe polarity. Fuse external branches as required. |
| Surge/Noise  | In noisy panels, add upstream surge/EMI suppression and keep high-current wiring away from control wiring. |

### ‚èΩ Inputs (Digital)

| Area        | Warning |
|-------------|---------|
| Type        | **Dry contact / 24 V signaling only**, per your standard. Do not inject mains or undefined levels. |
| Isolation   | Inputs are isolated from logic. Keep sensor returns on the **field/isolated** domain; do not bond to logic GND. |
| Debounce    | Firmware provides debounce, but route away from contactors/VFDs and use shielded/twisted pairs for long runs. |
| Polarity    | Configure invert/action in WebConfig; verify state transitions after wiring. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Relays (Outputs)

| Area           | Warning |
|----------------|---------|
| Contact Type   | **SPDT (NO/NC/COM)** dry contacts. Follow the contact rating on the device label/datasheet. |
| Inductive Loads| For motors/solenoids/contactors, add an **RC snubber or MOV** at the load. Consider interposing relays/ contactors for higher power. |
| Separation     | Keep relay load wiring physically separate from signal wiring. De-energize before servicing. |
| Verification   | After wiring, verify NO/NC behavior and load polarity before enabling automation. |

### üñß RS-485 (Modbus RTU)

| Area          | Warning |
|---------------|---------|
| Topology      | Use twisted pair; **daisy-chain** (no stubs). Terminate with **120 Œ©** at both physical ends. |
| Polarity      | Maintain **A/B** polarity consistently. Share **COM/GND** reference between nodes (same SELV domain). |
| EMC           | Route away from VFDs, contactors, and mains bundles. Use shielded cable in high-EMI environments. |
| Protection    | Port includes protection, but good wiring practice is still required to avoid transients. |

### üîå USB-C (Front / Setup)

| Area     | Warning |
|----------|---------|
| Purpose  | **Setup & maintenance only** (WebConfig / firmware). Not intended for powering field devices. |
| ESD/EMI  | Avoid hot-plugging in high-EMI areas. Use a grounded service laptop. Disconnect after commissioning. |

### üîÜ Front Panel (Buttons & LEDs)

| Area          | Warning |
|---------------|---------|
| Buttons & LEDs| Buttons can override relays; document operating procedures. Lock out overrides for safety-critical installs. |

### üõ°Ô∏è Shielding & EMC

| Area        | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Cable Shields| Terminate shields at **one end** (typically the PLC/controller). Keep runs short and away from high-voltage/EMI sources. |

---

## 4.1 What You Need

| Category          | Item / Notes |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Hardware**      | **DIO-430-R1** ‚Äî DIN-rail module with **4√ó DI**, **3√ó SPDT relays**, **3√ó buttons**, **3√ó LEDs**, **USB-C**, **RS-485**.  |
| **Controller (master)** | HomeMaster **MiniPLC/MicroPLC** or any **Modbus RTU** master. |
| **24 VDC PSU (SELV)** | Regulated **24 VDC**; size for logic + relay coils + sensors; inline panel fuse/breaker. Power input stage includes fuse/TVS/reverse-polarity protection.  |
| **RS-485 cable**  | Twisted pair for **A/B** + **COM/GND** reference, 120 Œ© termination at both ends of the trunk.  |
| **USB-C cable**   | For WebConfig via a Chromium browser (service/commissioning).  |
| **Software**      | **Chromium-based browser** with Web Serial (Chrome/Edge). Web page exposes **Address/Baud** + I/O mapping.  |
| **Field I/O**     | **Dry contacts** to DI1‚Ä¶DI4 (isolated front-end per channel). **Relays** (NO/NC/COM) drive LV loads or interposing contactors; add RC/MOV snubbers for inductive loads.  |

> **Quick path:** mount ‚Üí wire **24 VDC** + **RS-485 A/B/COM** ‚Üí connect **USB-C** ‚Üí WebConfig: set **Address/Baud** + map **inputs ‚Üí relays/LEDs** ‚Üí disconnect USB ‚Üí hand over to controller. 

---

## 4.2 Power

The module uses **24 VDC** primary. Onboard regulation provides **5 V ‚Üí 3.3 V** for logic; DI front-end is isolated.

### 4.2.1 Supply Types
- **24 VDC DIN-rail PSU** ‚Üí **24Vdc(+) / 0V(‚Äì)** power terminals (top row: POWER).   
- **Sensor side (DI)** ‚Äî isolated input receivers accept field signals; feed your sensors from the 24 V field rail and return to the **DI GND** pins (per-channel). Do **not** back-power logic from sensor rails. 

### 4.2.2 Sizing (rule of thumb)
Account for:
- Base electronics + LEDs  
- **Relay coils** (up to **3** simultaneously)  
- **Sensor rails** (DI field side, if powered from the same 24 V source)

> Size PSU for **worst-case relays + sensors**, then add **‚â•30 % headroom**.

### 4.2.3 Power Safety
- Correct polarity; keep logic **GND** and DI field ground **separate** (respect isolation domains).   
- Keep upstream **fusing/breaker** in place; the board also has input fuse/TVS/reverse-polarity MOSFET.   
- Use **snubbers** on inductive loads; prefer **interposing contactors** for motors/pumps.   
- **De-energize** before wiring; check shorts before power-up.

---

Runtime control is via **RS-485 (Modbus RTU)**. **USB-C** is for local setup/diagnostics (Web Serial).

### 4.3.1 RS-485 (Modbus RTU)

**Physical**
- **Terminals (lower front row):** **B**, **A**, **COM/GND** ‚Üí then DI and DI-GNDs. Maintain A/B polarity, share the **COM/GND** reference with the controller.   
- **Cable:** Twisted pair (preferably shielded) for A/B + reference.  
- **Termination:** **120 Œ©** at both physical ends of the trunk; avoid stubs. 

**Protocol**
- Role: **RTU slave**; controller is **master**.  
- **Address:** 1‚Äì255. **Factory default**: **Address 3**, **19200 8N1**.   
- Required: Dedicated **24 VDC** power (bus is data-only).

**Checklist**
- A‚ÜíA, B‚ÜíB, **COM‚ÜíCOM** (GND ref).  
- Two end terminations only; daisy-chain topology.  
- Consistent A/B polarity end-to-end.
