# MicroPLC â€“ Open-Source Automation Controller for Home & Industry

**MicroPLC** is a compact and powerful open-source automation controller based on the **ESP32-WROOM-32U**. Designed for seamless integration with **Home Assistant** using **ESPHome**, it enables control of smart home devices, sensors, actuators, and industrial systems through RS-485 Modbus and wireless communication.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

MicroPLC serves as a central unit for managing digital and analog I/O extension modules, executing automation logic, and connecting sensors and actuators. With its modular design and DIN-rail mount enclosure, itâ€™s ideal for electrical panels in smart homes, HVAC systems, lighting control, and industrial process monitoring.

Out of the box, MicroPLC comes with ESPHome pre-installed and ready to integrate with Home Assistant or other MQTT-based platforms.
