## üå°Ô∏è Description

The Opentherm Gateway enables full bidirectional OpenTherm communication for intelligent climate control. It supports monitoring and control of key heating parameters such as burner status, flame modulation, setpoint temperatures, and system diagnostics.

A built-in high-voltage relay allows local control of zone valves or backup heaters, while two independent **1-Wire interfaces** support digital temperature sensors (e.g., DS18B20) for detailed room or system temperature monitoring.

Designed for seamless integration with **ESPHome** and **Home Assistant**, the gateway allows OTA updates, local LED indicators, and configuration via USB Type-C.

## üè† Integration with Home Assistant

When flashed with ESPHome, the Opentherm Gateway exposes the following entities in Home Assistant:

- Boiler on/off
- Burner status
- Flame modulation level (%)
- CH/DHW setpoint temperatures
- Boiler water temperature
- System pressure (if supported)
- Relay output status
- Temperature readings from connected 1-Wire sensors
- etc.

These enable complex automations like zone heating, backup switching, or temperature-based schedules‚Äîall managed within Home Assistant.
