## 1.2 ALM-173-R1 ‚Äî Supported Controllers üîå


The **ALM-173-R1** is an intelligent expansion module for the **HomeMaster MiniPLC / MicroPLC Modular Smart Control System**.

### MiniPLC / MicroPLC (via Modbus RTU)

| Feature          | Specification                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Controller Role** | Operates as a **Modbus Slave**. The MiniPLC/MicroPLC acts as the **Modbus Master** for network and system logic management.                          |
| **Communication**   | **Modbus RTU** (Serial).                                                                                                                             |
| **Physical Interface** | **RS-485** bus (using dedicated **UART2** pins).                                                                                                    |
| **Function**         | Master can **read** all I/O data (Flow, Heat, Leak Status) and **write** commands to actuate **Relays R1, R2** and control **irrigation zones**.     |
| **Modular Design**   | RS-485 architecture supports **daisy-chaining** multiple ALM-173-R1 modules and other expansion units for scalable I/O.                               |
| **Default ID**       | Factory-set **Modbus Slave ID: 3**.                                                                                                                  |

> **Note:** If multiple ALM-173-R1 modules share the same RS-485 segment, change the slave ID on each unit to avoid address conflicts.

## 1.3 Use Cases üõ†Ô∏è

Below are practical ways to deploy the **ALM-173-R1** with the HomeMaster Mini/Micro PLC (or any Modbus RTU master). Each recipe uses only features available in the firmware + Web Serial UI: **Input Enable/Invert/Group**, **Relay Enable/Invert/Group**, **Alarm Modes** (*None / Active while condition* / *Latched until acknowledged*), **Buttons** (ack & manual relay override), and **User LEDs** (steady/blink; sources like *Any Alarm*, *Group 1..3*, *Relay overridden*).

---

### 1) Intrusion zone with siren, latched until acknowledgment
- **Goal:** Trip a siren when a door/PIR is triggered; hold the alarm until acknowledges.
- **How:**  
  1. Wire the detector to **IN1**. In **Digital Inputs**, set **IN1 ‚Üí Enabled**, **Group = Group 1**; use **Invert** if the contact is NC.  
  2. In **Alarm Modes**, set **Group 1 = Latched until acknowledged**.  
  3. In **Relays**, set **Relay 1 ‚Üí Enabled, Group = Group 1** (Invert if the siren needs opposite polarity).  
  4. In **Buttons**, set **Button 1 = Alarm group 1 acknowledge**.  
  5. In **User LEDs**, map **LED 1 ‚Üí Source = Alarm group 1**, **Mode = Blink** for visual cue.  
  6. The PLC reads Group 1 status and ‚ÄúAny Alarm‚Äù over Modbus for logging and notifications.

---

### 2) Dual-door supervision with common strobe and separate acks
- **Goal:** Two doors report separately, a common strobe flashes on any breach, and each zone can be acknowledged locally.
- **How:**  
  1. **IN1 ‚Üí Group 1** (Door A), **IN2 ‚Üí Group 2** (Door B).  
  2. **Alarm Modes:** Group 1 = *Latched until acknowledged*, Group 2 = *Latched until acknowledged*.  
  3. **Relay 1 ‚Üí Group 1**, **Relay 2 ‚Üí Group 2** (drive individual buzzers/locks).  
  4. **Relay 3 ‚Üí Group = None**; PLC toggles it as a **common strobe** via Modbus when *Any Alarm* is active.  
  5. **Button 1 = Alarm group 1 acknowledge**, **Button 2 = Alarm group 2 acknowledge**.  
  6. **LED 1 = Group 1**, **LED 2 = Group 2**, **LED 3 = Any Alarm**.

---

### 3) Equipment room: summary fault to PLC + lamp tower
- **Goal:** Collect many dry contacts (smoke, thermal, UPS, flooding) and present a **summary alarm** locally and to the HA.
- **How:**  
  1. Map **IN1..IN8 ‚Üí Group 1** (all fault inputs). Use **Invert** per sensor type (NO/NC).  
  2. **Alarm Modes:** Group 1 = *Active while condition is active* (non-latched).  
  3. Wire a **red stack light** to **Relay 1**, set **Relay 1 ‚Üí Group 1**.  
  4. **LED 1 = Any Alarm** (Blink) for panel indication.  
  5. PLC reads **Any Alarm** and **Group 1** bits via Modbus for HA alarms.

---

### 4) Access door with strike control and door-left-open timer (via PLC)
- **Goal:** PLC unlocks a strike, supervises the door contact, and alarms if the door is left open too long.
- **How:**  
  1. **IN1 = Door contact ‚Üí Group 3** (Invert if NC).  
  2. **Relays:** **Relay 1** wired to the strike, **Group = None** (PLC controls it directly over Modbus).  
  3. PLC logic: when access granted ‚Üí energize **Relay 1**; start a **door-open timer**; if **IN1** stays active past timeout, raise **Group 3 alarm** (or directly drive **Relay 2** as buzzer).  
  4. **Button 4 = Alarm group 3 acknowledge** for guard reset; **LED 3 = Group 3**.

---

### 5) Panel-mount annunciator with ‚ÄúAny Alarm‚Äù lamp
- **Goal:** Use the front panel as a mini-annunciator while PLC handles supervision.
- **How:**  
  1. Map various inputs **IN1..INn ‚Üí Group 1..3** as needed.  
  2. **Alarm Modes:** choose **Active while** for live indication or **Latched** for operator intervention.  
  3. **User LEDs:**  
     - **LED 1 = Any Alarm (Blink)**  
     - **LED 2 = Group 1**, **LED 3 = Group 2**, **LED 4 = Group 3**  
  4. PLC mirrors lamp states on an HA and logs alarm history.

# 2. Safety Information

This section outlines essential safety guidelines specific to the **ALM-173-R1** alarm I/O module. Failure to follow these instructions may result in equipment damage, system failure, or personal injury.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **SELV/LV only.** The ALM-173-R1 is intended for **Safety Extra‚ÄìLow Voltage (SELV)** installations. Do **not** connect mains voltages to any terminal.

---

## 2.1 General Electrical Safety

| Warning | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Professional Service** | Installation and maintenance must be performed by **qualified personnel** familiar with local electrical codes and control-panel practices. |
| **Power Isolation** | **Always** isolate the primary **24 VDC** supply and all connected loads before wiring, servicing, or moving the module. Lock-out/Tag-out where applicable. |
| **Polarity & Ratings** | Verify the supply polarity and that all connected circuits remain within the module‚Äôs specified **voltage and current** limits. Use an upstream fuse or breaker. |
| **Grounding** | Bond the control panel to protective earth. Keep **SELV returns** and shields properly managed; avoid earth loops. |
| **Environmental** | Install in a **dry, clean, indoor** enclosure with adequate ventilation. Keep away from condensation, conductive dust, and vibration. |

---

## 2.2 Handling & Installation

| Requirement | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ESD Protection** | Handle the product by its case; when boards are exposed, wear an **ESD wrist strap** and use an antistatic workstation. |
| **DIN-Rail Mounting** | Mount on **35 mm DIN rail** inside a protective enclosure. Secure the rail and provide strain relief for all field wiring. |
| **Wiring** | Use insulated wire of appropriate gauge and temperature rating per code and **terminal block ratings**. **Tighten all screws**; loose connections can overheat. Route **signal, power, and relay** wiring separately. |
| **Isolation Boundaries** | The module contains **isolated field supplies** and **opto-isolated inputs**. Do **not** bridge isolated returns to logic ground unless the system design requires it. |
| **Commissioning** | After wiring, verify correct **polarity**, **bus polarity (A/B)**, and **relay contact routing (COM/NO/NC)** before energizing. Perform functional tests with loads disconnected first. |

---

## 2.3 Device-Specific Warnings

| Component / Area | Warning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Power (24 VDC)** | Use a clean, SELV 24 VDC source. Reverse-polarity protection is limited‚Äî**incorrect wiring can damage the unit**. Provide an upstream fuse/breaker sized for your installation. |
| **Isolated Sensor Supplies ‚Äî ‚ÄúOUTPUT 12 Vdc (PS/1)‚Äù & ‚ÄúOUTPUT 5 Vdc (PS/2)‚Äù** | These rails are **isolated** and intended **only for low-power sensors**. Do **not** backfeed from external supplies, parallel with other rails, or exceed the current budget. Short circuits may trip onboard **PTC fuses**; allow them to cool to auto-reset. |
| **Digital Inputs (DI1‚Ä¶DI17)** | Inputs are **opto-isolated** and share labeled **GND I.x** returns. Connect **dry contacts** or **low-voltage isolated** signals only. Applying high AC/DC or non-isolated industrial voltages will **breach the isolation barrier** and can destroy the module. Respect debounce/invert settings in firmware rather than hardwiring unsafe workarounds. |
| **Relay Outputs (RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3, COM/NO/NC)** | Relays are **dry contacts** (no internal source of power). **Do not exceed** their contact voltage/current ratings. Inductive loads (coils, locks, sirens) **must** be snubbed (RC / TVS) externally to prevent arcing and premature contact wear. Use separate supply returns for high-current loads; avoid routing load current through logic returns. |
| **RS-485 (A/B, COM)** | Use **twisted pair** (preferably shielded). Maintain correct **A/B polarity**. Termination/biasing should be applied **once per bus** as per system design. The port includes protection (TVS/PTC) for transients, but it is **not a lightning arrestor**‚Äîroute cabling appropriately and use surge protection where required. |
| **USB-C (Front ‚ÄúUSB‚Äù)** | Intended for **service/configuration** only. Do **not** use to power field devices. Connect to grounded/isolated PCs. During electrical storms or when the RS-485 trunk is long/exposed, avoid connecting a laptop to the panel. |
| **Front-Panel Buttons & LEDs** | Buttons can acknowledge alarms or override relays. **Accidental presses** may change system state‚Äîuse enclosure doors/covers or disable overrides in firmware where safety-critical. |
| **Shielding & EMC** | Terminate cable shields **at one end** unless your EMC plan specifies otherwise. Keep RS-485 and input cabling away from contactors, VFDs, and high-dv/dt conductors. |

---

> ‚úÖ **Checklist before powering up**
> - All terminals tightened and strain-relieved  
> - No bridges between **isolated** and **logic** grounds unless intentional  
> - Relays wired with correct **COM/NO/NC** choice and snubbers fitted  
> - RS-485 polarity and termination verified  
> - Sensor loads on **PS/1 (12 V)** and **PS/2 (5 V)** within budget

# 3. System Overview
## 3.1 Architecture & Modular Design

The **ALM-173-R1 (Alarm I/O, 17 Inputs, 3 Relays)** is a DIN-rail Modbus extension module for distributed alarm and annunciator tasks. It‚Äôs configured entirely from a browser via **Web Serial**, exposing a clear model of **inputs ‚Üí alarm groups ‚Üí relays/LEDs**, plus local **buttons** for acknowledgments and manual overrides.

### Core I/O & Indicators
- **17√ó Digital Inputs (IN1‚Ä¶IN17):** each input can be **Enabled**, **Inverted**, and assigned to **Alarm Group 1/2/3** or **None**. The UI shows a live dot for every input.
- **3√ó Relays (RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3):** per-relay **Enable**, **Invert**, and **Group** mapping; live state feedback shown in the UI.
- **4√ó Buttons:** assign actions such as **All acknowledge**, **Group 1/2/3 acknowledge**, or **Relay 1/2/3 override (manual)**; button press state is shown live.
- **4√ó User LEDs:** pick **Mode** (*Steady* / *Blink*) and **Source** (*Any alarm*, *Group 1/2/3*, *Relay 1/2/3 overridden*); live LED state is indicated.
- **Alarm Engine:** **Any Alarm** summary plus **Group 1/2/3** with per-group **Mode**: *None*, *Active while condition is active (non-latched)*, or *Latched until acknowledged*. Group status indicators are displayed at the top of the UI.

### Communication & Setup
- **RS-485 / Modbus RTU:** Polled by a PLC/HMI (HomeMaster Mini/Micro or any Modbus master). UI provides **Address (1‚Ä¶255)** and **Baud** selections (9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200).
- **WebConfig over USB-C:** One-click **Connect**, view **Active Modbus Configuration** (address/baud), stream a **Serial Log**, and issue a confirmed **Reset Device**.

### Local Resilience & Behavior
- **On-device mappings** let inputs assert alarm groups and drive relays/LEDs without a PC, while a PLC orchestrates higher-level logic over Modbus.
- **Buttons** provide local **acknowledge** and **manual relay override** functions for maintenance and operator workflows.
- **Real-time telemetry** mirrors the device: **input states**, **relay states**, **button presses**, **LED states**, and **alarm group/summary status**. Configuration changes are sent immediately as lists (e.g., *inputEnable*, *inputInvert*, *inputGroup*, *relays*, *buttons*, *leds*, *alarms*).

## 3.2 Integration with Home Assistant

The **ALM-173-R1** integrates with **Home Assistant (HA)** through the **HomeMaster controller (MiniPLC/MicroPLC)** running **ESPHome**. The controller acts as a **Modbus RTU master** over RS-485, periodically polling the ALM-173-R1 and publishing friendly entities to HA. No custom add-ons are required on HA‚Äîeverything is handled on the controller.

### Communication Path
- **Topology:** Home Assistant ‚Üî ESPHome (on HomeMaster) ‚Üî RS-485 ‚Üî ALM-173-R1  
- **Role split:**  
  - **ALM-173-R1:** executes local alarm logic (inputs ‚Üí groups ‚Üí relays/LEDs, buttons for ack/override).  
  - **ESPHome:** performs Modbus reads/writes and exposes states/actions as HA entities.  
  - **Home Assistant:** dashboards, notifications, automations, scenes.

### What Home Assistant Sees (via ESPHome)
- **Binary sensors**
  - **Inputs:** DI1‚Ä¶DI17 as individual `binary_sensor` entities (open/closed, active/inactive).
  - **Alarm groups:** Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, and **Any Alarm** summary for annunciation and logic.
  - **Optional:** Button press states (useful for diagnostics/maintenance).
- **Switches**
  - **Relays:** R1‚Ä¶R3 as `switch` entities for manual testing or HA-driven actuation.
  - **Actions as switches/scripts:** ‚ÄúAcknowledge All‚Äù, ‚ÄúAcknowledge Group 1/2/3‚Äù, and **manual relay override** can be exposed as HA `switch` or `script` entities that perform the underlying Modbus command.
- **Device health**
  - **Availability:** ESPHome marks entities unavailable if the Modbus link is down; HA can alert on loss of comms.
  - **Diagnostics (optional):** readback of active baud/address and last update timestamp, surfaced as HA attributes.

> Note: The ALM‚Äôs **LED sources/modes** and **mapping** are configured on the device/UI and typically not changed from HA during normal operation. HA consumes the resulting **group/any** status to drive notifications and scenes.

### Recommended HA Automations (Examples of Behavior)
- **Alarm annunciation:** When **Any Alarm** turns ON, send a **mobile push** with a list of active inputs; optionally flash a smart light or activate a siren **only if** ‚ÄúService Mode‚Äù is OFF.
- **Per-group workflows:** If **Group 1** (e.g., intrusion) goes **latched**, notify security and highlight the zone on a dashboard; expose an **Acknowledge Group 1** action.
- **Night mode:** Use an HA `input_boolean.night_mode` to suppress local siren relays (keep logging/notifications active). HA can still command remote notifiers (e.g., GSM dialer) via the controller.
- **Maintenance mode:** Temporarily inhibit relays from HA while keeping inputs visible; show a banner on the dashboard reminding operators that outputs are inhibited.
- **Watchdog:** If entities become **unavailable** (Modbus fault), raise a **Critical** alert and create a persistent HA notification.


### Best Practices
- **Let the ALM do the fast/critical work** (local group logic and latching). Use HA for **orchestration**: notifications, schedules, and mode management.
- **Keep a single source of truth** for acknowledges and overrides (prefer ALM/ESPHome actions; reflect state in HA).
- **Use HA helpers** (`input_boolean`, `input_select`) for modes like **Night** or **Maintenance**, gating HA‚Äôs decision to drive relays.
- **Secure the service port** (USB) and require operator authentication for any HA dashboard actions that acknowledge alarms or force overrides.

> You do **not** need to include firmware examples or a Modbus register table in this README. The ESPHome profile for ALM-173-R1 encapsulates the mapping and exposes ready-to-use entities and actions to Home Assistant.

## 4.2 Powering the Devices

The ALM-173-R1 is powered from a **24 VDC primary input** on the field board. On-board regulators generate the internal rails for logic and provide **isolated 5 V / 12 V auxiliary rails** intended for low-power sensors.

> Relays are **dry contacts** (SPDT). Do **not** power valves/motors/lamps from the module‚Äôs internal rails; use a dedicated external supply and switch it via the relay contacts.

---

### 4.2.1 Power Supply Types

- **Regulated 24 VDC DIN-rail PSU:** Connect to the module‚Äôs **+V / 0V** power terminals. Size the PSU for the module plus any externally powered devices.
- **No power over RS-485:** The RS-485 bus carries signals only. Always provide local 24 VDC power to the module.
- **Sensor power from module:** Use the **isolated** rails ‚Äî **+5 V** and **+12 V** ‚Äî to power **low-power field sensors** connected to the DI terminals.  



---


### 4.2.2 Current Consumption

Actual current depends on configuration and what‚Äôs attached. Budget for:
- **Base electronics (logic/MCU/LEDs).**
- **Relays:** add coil current for each energized relay.
- **Sensor rails:** total draw of any devices on the isolated **+5 V / +12 V** rails.

**Sizing tip:** choose a 24 V supply that covers base load + worst-case **both relays ON** + all sensor current, with at least **30% headroom** for startup and temperature.

---

### 4.2.3 Power Safety Tips

- **Polarity & grounds:** Observe **24 V polarity** and keep logic ground and isolated sensor ground separate as designed.
- **Fusing & protection:** Keep upstream over-current protection (fuse/breaker). Do not bypass on-board protective elements.
- **Relay contact ratings:** Treat relay outputs as isolated contacts; follow the contact rating from the relay datasheet and local electrical codes.
- **Use sensor rails only for sensors:** Do **not** power valves, pumps, or sirens from the module‚Äôs **+5 V / +12 V** sensor rails.
- **De-energize before wiring:** Power down the 24 V supply before changing wiring. Double-check for shorts before re-energizing.
---

### 4.3 Networking & Communication

The ALM-173-R1 communicates with the controller over **RS-485 (Modbus RTU)** and exposes a **USB-C** port for local configuration via a browser (**Web Serial**). RS-485 is used for runtime control/telemetry; USB-C is used for setup, diagnostics, and safe resets. RS-485 carries **signals only** (no power).

---

#### 4.3.1 RS-485 Modbus

**Physical layer**
- **Terminals:** **A**, **B**, **COM (GND)** on the field board.
- **Cabling:** 2-wire twisted pair for **A/B** plus a **common reference (COM/GND)**.
- **Termination:** 120 Œ© at the two ends of the bus. Keep stubs short.
- **Protection & robustness:** On-board surge suppressors/TVS and self-resetting fuses protect the transceiver; biasing and a MAX485-class transceiver handle the differential link.

**Protocol**
- **Role:** Modbus **RTU slave** on the RS-485 multi-drop bus; your MicroPLC/MiniPLC acts as **master**.
- **Address & speed:** Set **Address (1‚Äì255)** and **Baud** in WebConfig. Default/common speed is **19200**, 8N1.
- **No power over RS-485:** Provide 24 VDC locally to the module; RS-485 only carries data.

**Controller (ESPHome) notes**
- In your ESPHome YAML, configure `uart:` pins for the RS-485 transceiver and add a `modbus_controller:` for this device.
- Ensure the `alm_address` in YAML matches the address set in WebConfig.
- The controller will poll coils/holding registers and expose relays, DI states and alarms status as Home Assistant entities.

**Wiring checklist**
- A‚ÜíA, B‚ÜíB, COM‚ÜîCOM between controller and module.
- Terminate the two bus ends; avoid star topologies.
- Keep A/B polarity consistent end-to-end.

---

#### 4.3.2 USB-C Configuration

**Purpose**
- Local setup and diagnostics via a **Chromium-based browser** (Chrome/Edge) using the **Web Serial API**. No drivers needed.

**How to use**
1. Connect a **USB-C** cable from your computer to the module.
2. Open the configuration page and click **Connect**.
3. Use the **Modbus** card to set **Address** and **Baud**; the header shows **Active Modbus Configuration**.
4. Configure **Digital Inputs**, **Relays**, **LEDs/Buttons**. Changes are applied live.
5. Use **Serial Log** for diagnostics.

**Troubleshooting**
- If the **Connect** button is disabled, ensure you‚Äôre using Chrome/Edge and that the browser has permission to access serial devices.

---

## 4.4 Quick Setup

**Phase 1 ‚Äî Physical Wiring**

- **Power:** connect a regulated **24 VDC** supply to the **V+ / 0 V** POWER terminals.
- **RS-485:** wire **A ‚Üí A**, **B ‚Üí B**, and **COM/GND** between the **ALM-173-R1** and your controller. Keep polarity consistent. Terminate the two ends of the bus with **120 Œ©** and apply biasing per your trunk design.
- **Digital inputs:** connect dry-contact/isolated signals to **IN1‚Ä¶IN17**; use the matching **GND I.x** returns printed on the lower terminal row.
- **Relays:** wire loads to **RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3 (COM/NO/NC)**. Use external **RC snubbers/TVS** for coils, locks, sirens, etc. Observe relay voltage/current ratings.
- **Isolated sensor power (optional):** low-power sensors can be fed from **PS/1 = +12 V iso** and **PS/2 = +5 V iso**. Do **not** backfeed or parallel these rails.

_For wiring safety, terminal maps, and cable practices, see your **Installation & Wiring** section._

---

**Phase 2 ‚Äî Module Configuration (WebConfig)**

- **Connect:** plug a **USB-C** cable into the front service port and open the **ALM-173-R1 Config Tool** in a Chromium-based browser. Click **Connect**.
- **Set Modbus:** choose a unique **Modbus Address (1‚Äì255)** and a **Baud** rate (e.g., 9600/19200/38400/57600/115200). The header shows the **Active Modbus Configuration**.
- **Alarm modes:** for **Group 1/2/3**, pick **None**, **Active while condition is active (non-latched)**, or **Latched until acknowledged**.
- **Digital Inputs (IN1‚Ä¶IN17):** per input, set **Enabled**, **Inverted**, and **Alarm Group** (*None/1/2/3*). Watch the live state dot to verify wiring.
- **Relays (RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3):** set **Enabled**, **Inverted**, and **Alarm Group** mapping. The UI shows each relay‚Äôs live state.
- **Buttons (4):** assign actions such as **All acknowledge**, **Group 1/2/3 acknowledge**, or **Relay 1/2/3 override (manual)**.
- **User LEDs (4):** choose **Mode** (*Steady* / *Blink*) and **Source** (*Any alarm*, *Group 1/2/3*, *Relay 1/2/3 overridden*). Live LED status is shown.
- (Optional) **Reset Device** from the confirmation dialog if you need to restart the module; the browser will reconnect.

> For more details about **WebConfig** cards and fields, see **[Software & UI Configuration](#6-software--ui-configuration)**.

---

**Phase 3 ‚Äî Controller Integration**

- **Controller role:** your MiniPLC/MicroPLC (or any Modbus master) polls the ALM-173-R1 over **RS-485** and exposes states/actions to your HMI or Home Assistant (via ESPHome on the controller, if used).
- **Match parameters:** ensure the controller‚Äôs **address** and **baud** match what you set in WebConfig.
- **Commission:** read DI and Alarm Group states from the controller; toggle relays for a functional test; expose ‚ÄúAcknowledge‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverride‚Äù actions if desired.

> For protocol details and end-to-end examples, see **[Modbus RTU Communication](#7-modbus-rtu-communication)** and **[ESPHome Integration Guide (MicroPLC/MiniPLC + ALM-173-R1)](#8-esphome-integration-guide-microplcminiplc--alm-173-r1)**.

---

**Verify**

- **LEDs:** **PWR** should be **steady ON**; **TX/RX** should **blink** when the controller is communicating.
- **Inputs:** short/open a few inputs and confirm the **live dots** and **Group/Any** indicators react accordingly.
- **Relays:** command each relay from the UI or controller and verify field wiring (use a meter or indicator load).
- **Buttons/LEDs:** press front buttons to **acknowledge** or **override** as configured; confirm user LEDs reflect the chosen sources and modes.

# 5. Installation & Wiring

# 5. Installation & Wiring

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety first.** Work must be performed by qualified personnel. De-energize the panel and verify with a meter before wiring. The ALM-173-R1 is a **SELV/low-voltage** device; do not connect mains to any logic/input terminal.

---

## 5.1 RS-485 Field Bus (Modbus RTU)

![RS-485 wiring to controller with 120Œ© end-of-line termination](Images/ALM_RS485Connection.png)

The controller is wired to the ALM-173-R1 using a twisted pair for **A/B** plus a **COM/GND** reference. A **120 Œ©** end-of-line resistor is installed across **A‚ÄìB** at the far end of the trunk.

**How to wire**

1. Use shielded twisted pair (e.g., 24‚Äì22 AWG).  
2. Wire **A ‚Üí A**, **B ‚Üí B**, **COM/GND ‚Üí COM**; keep polarity consistent on all nodes.  
3. Terminate the **two physical ends** of the trunk with **120 Œ©** between **A‚ÄìB**.  
4. Bond the cable shield at **one point** only (usually at the controller) to avoid ground loops.  
5. Daisy-chain topology is recommended; avoid star wiring.

---

## 5.2 Primary Power (24 VDC)

![24 VDC power wiring to V+ and 0V](Images/ALM_24Vdc_PowerSupply.png)

A regulated **24 VDC** supply connects to the top-left **POWER** terminals: **V+** (red) and **0 V** (blue).

**How to wire**

- Provide a clean SELV **24 VDC** source sized for the ALM plus any sensors powered from its isolated rails.  
- Observe polarity (**V+ / 0 V**).  
- Use an upstream fuse or breaker and proper panel bonding.  

---

## 5.3 Digital Inputs (IN1‚Ä¶IN17)

![Dry-contact sensors to inputs with per-group returns](Images/ALM_DigitalInputs.png)

Dry-contact sensors are wired between each **INx** and the matching **GND I.x** return on the lower terminal row.

**How to wire**

- Inputs are **opto-isolated** and expect **dry contacts** or isolated low-voltage signals.  
- For each input, connect the sensor between **INx** and its **GND I.x** return as labeled on the front panel.  
- Do **not** inject external voltage into the inputs.  
- Use shielded cable for long runs and keep input wiring away from high-dv/dt conductors.  
- Configure each input in the WebConfig UI (**Enable / Invert / Group**) and verify with the live state dot.

---

## 5.4 Relay Outputs (RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3, COM/NO/NC)

![Relays used as dry contacts to switch an external AC line via breaker](Images/ALM_RelayConnection.png)

Each relay operates as a **dry contact** to switch an external supply. The example shows **NO** used to switch an AC line from a breaker (**L**) to the loads, with **N** routed directly.

**How to wire**

1. Bring the external supply **line (L)** to the relay **COM** terminal.  
2. From **NO** (or **NC** if fail-active behavior is needed) go to the load; return the other side of the load to **N/0 V** of the external supply.  
3. The relays **do not source power**‚Äîthey only switch your external circuit.  
4. Respect relay voltage/current ratings and local electrical codes.  
5. Fit **RC snubbers or TVS** across inductive loads (locks, sirens, coils) to minimize arcing and EMI.

---

## 5.5 Final Checks

- All terminals torqued; strain relief applied.  
- **Isolation boundaries** respected (no unintended bonds between **GND_ISO** and logic ground).  
- RS-485 polarity, termination, and biasing verified.  
- Relays wired with the correct **COM/NO/NC** choice; snubbers fitted where needed.  
- Power up: **PWR** LED steady **ON**; **TX/RX** **blink** when the controller communicates.

# 6 Software & UI Configuration

## 6.1 How to Connect to the Module

![ALM-173-R1 WebConfig ‚Äî Active Modbus Configuration](Images/webconfig1.png)

1. **Plug in USB-C.** Connect your computer to the ALM-173-R1‚Äôs USB-C port.  
2. **Open the config page.** In a Chromium-based browser (Chrome/Edge), open  
   **https://www.home-master.eu/configtool-alm-173-r1**  
3. **Click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.** When prompted, allow the browser to access the serial device.  
4. **Confirm connection.** The **Serial Log** shows events and the banner displays the **Active Modbus Configuration** (current **Address** and **Baud Rate**).  
5. **(Optional) Reset Device.** Click **Reset Device** for a safe reboot; the serial link will drop and then reconnect automatically.

> If you cannot connect to the module, check that no other app (serial console, uploader, etc.) is already using the USB port, and verify the browser has permission to access it. On macOS/Linux, ensure your user has the required USB serial permissions.

## 6.2 How to Configure Modbus

Use the top **Modbus Address** and **Baud Rate** selectors. Changes are sent to the device immediately; the **Serial Log** confirms with messages like ‚ÄúModbus configuration updated‚Äù and ‚ÄúConfiguration saved.‚Äù

- **Set Address (1‚Ä¶255):** Choose a **unique** Modbus RTU address for this module.  
- **Set Baud:** Pick one of the supported rates: **9600**, **19200** (default), **38400**, **57600**, **115200**.  
- **Verify live status:** The banner updates to show **Address** and **Baud Rate** currently active on the device.  
- **Controller match:** In your controller‚Äôs ESPHome YAML, ensure `uart` settings match your RS-485 pins/speed and set `wld_address` to the same address you chose here (e.g., `wld_address: "6"`).

> You can revisit this page anytime to adjust Modbus parameters. Configuration persists in the module‚Äôs flash memory.

## 6.3 How to Set Alarm Modes

Use the **Mode ‚Äì Group 1/2/3** dropdowns to select the behavior for each group:
- **None** ‚Äî group disabled.
- **Active while condition is active** ‚Äî turns ON only while mapped inputs are active.
- **Latched until acknowledged** ‚Äî stays ON after a trigger until acknowledged.

Top-row dots show live status for **Any Alarm**, **Group 1**, **Group 2**, **Group 3** (gray = idle, lit = active).
![1-Wire Devices ‚Äî WebConfig](./Images/webconfig2.png)


Use the **Mode ‚Äì Group 1/2/3** dropdowns to select the behavior for each group:
- **None** ‚Äî group disabled.
- **Active while condition is active** ‚Äî turns ON only while mapped inputs are active.
- **Latched until acknowledged** ‚Äî stays ON after a trigger until acknowledged.

## 6.4 How to Configure Digital Inputs

![Digital Inputs ‚Äî WebConfig](./Images/webconfig3.png)

For each input **IN1‚Ä¶IN17**:

- **Enabled** ‚Äî check to activate the input. (Unchecked = ignored by the alarm engine.)
- **Inverted** ‚Äî check if the sensor is **NC** (closed = normal). This makes ‚Äúopen‚Äù read as **active**.
- **Alarm Group** ‚Äî choose **None**, **1**, **2**, or **3** to route the input into a group.

The small dot in the top-right of each card shows the **live state** (off = idle, on = active) so you can verify wiring immediately.

## 6.5 How to Configure Relays

![Relays ‚Äî WebConfig](./Images/webconfig4.png)


For each **Relay 1‚Ä¶3**:

- **Enabled** ‚Äî allow the relay to operate. (Unchecked = relay forced **OFF**.)
- **Inverted** ‚Äî flips the logic so the **energized** state reads opposite (useful for field wiring that is active-low).
- **Alarm Group** ‚Äî choose how the relay is driven:
  - **None (0)** ‚Äî relay does **not** follow any group; use only for manual/PLC control.
  - **Group 1 / Group 2 / Group 3 (1‚Äì3)** ‚Äî relay **follows** the selected group‚Äôs state (including **latched** behavior if that mode is chosen).
  - **Modbus/Master (4)** ‚Äî relay is **controller-controlled** (ESPHome/PLC writes it directly).

> Tip: For maintenance tests, assign a front-panel **Button** to ‚ÄúRelay x override (manual)‚Äù so you can toggle the relay locally while commissioning.

---


## 6.6 How to Configure LEDs and Buttons

## 7.7 Override Priority

<a id="8-esphome-integration-guide-microplcminiplc-alm-173-r1-1"></a>
# 8. [ESPHome Integration Guide (MicroPLC/MiniPLC + ALM-173-R1)]

## 8.1 Hardware & RS-485 Wiring

1) **Power**  
- **ALM-173-R1:** supply **24 V DC** to **V+ / 0 V**.  
- **MicroPLC/MiniPLC:** per controller spec.  
- If the ALM and PLC have different PSUs, also share the **COM/GND** reference between devices.

2) **RS-485**  
- Wire **A‚ÜîA**, **B‚ÜîB** with a twisted pair; terminate the two bus ends (~**120 Œ©**), bias at the master.  
- Default serial (firmware/UI): **19200 8N1**; device **address** is configurable (examples below use `5`).

3) **Field I/O (typical)**  
- **IN1‚Ä¶IN17:** dry contacts (door/PIR/tamper/aux). Map each to **Group 1/2/3** in WebConfig.  
- **Relays RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3:** siren/lock/indicator (dry contacts).  
- **Buttons/LEDs:** local **acknowledge** / **manual override** and visual status (Any/Group/Override).

---

## 8.2 ESPHome (PLC): Enable Modbus RTU & Import the ALM Package

Your MiniPLC usually already defines UART+Modbus. Import the **ALM** package and use the **exact variable names** shown (`enm_prefix`, `enm_id`, `enm_address`):

```yaml
uart:
  id: uart_modbus
  tx_pin: 17
  rx_pin: 16
  baud_rate: 19200
  parity: NONE
  stop_bits: 1

modbus:
  id: modbus_bus
  uart_id: uart_modbus

packages:
  alm1:
    url: https://github.com/isystemsautomation/HOMEMASTER
    ref: main
    files:
      - path: ALM-173-R1/Firmware/default_alm_173_r1_plc/default_alm_173_r1_plc.yaml
        vars:
          alm_prefix: "ALM#1"   # appears in HA entity names
          alm_id: alm_1         # unique internal ID
          ealm_address: 5        # set to your module‚Äôs Modbus ID
    refresh: 1d
```

> Add multiple ALMs by duplicating the `alm1:` block (`alm2:`, `alm3:`‚Ä¶) with unique `alm_id` / `alm_address` / `alm_prefix`.

---

## 8.3 What the External ALM Package Exposes (Entities)

The bundled **`default_alm_173_r1_plc.yaml`** publishes ready-to-use entities; addressing is embedded, so you don‚Äôt hand-map registers.

- **Binary sensors**
  - **IN1‚Ä¶IN17** (debounced digital inputs).
  - **Alarm summary & groups:** **Any Alarm**, **Group 1**, **Group 2**, **Group 3**.
  - **Buttons pressed:** BTN1‚Ä¶BTN4 (diagnostics).
  - **Relay/LED mirrors:** readbacks for dashboards.

- **Switches**
  - **RLY1‚Ä¶RLY3** (ON/OFF) for manual or HA-driven actuation.
  - **Acknowledge** actions (All / G1 / G2 / G3) as script/switch helpers.
  - **Override** actions for **Relay 1/2/3** (force ON/OFF, then release).

- **Numbers/Selects (optional)**
  - Readbacks for **address/baud**, group **modes**, and per-channel **enable/invert/group** (mostly for diagnostics or advanced provisioning).

> The ALM‚Äôs **LED sources/modes** and input/relay **group mapping** are usually configured in WebConfig; HA consumes the resulting states.

---

## 8.4 Command Coils You Can Use (Writes; FC05 / Read via FC01)

The package implements **pulse-safe** helpers (they auto-release after writing):

- **Relays**  
  - **R1 ON** / **OFF**, **R2 ON** / **OFF**, **R3 ON** / **OFF**

- **Overrides**  
  - **Override ON** / **Override OFF** for **R1/R2/R3** (forces relay regardless of group/master until released)

- **Acknowledges**  
  - **Ack All**, **Ack Group 1**, **Ack Group 2**, **Ack Group 3**

- **Input helpers (optional)**  
  - **Enable/Disable INx** pulses for commissioning workflows

These appear as internal ESPHome switches or scripts that you can call from HA automations.

---

## 8.5 Using Your MiniPLC YAML with ALM

1) Keep the existing **UART/Modbus** blocks (pins/baud).  
2) Add the **`packages:`** block above and set **`alm_address`** to the ALM‚Äôs address from WebConfig.  
3) Flash the controller; ESPHome will discover entities under **`alm_prefix`** (e.g., `ALM#1 IN1`, `ALM#1 Any Alarm`, `ALM#1 Relay 1`).  
4) Place the entities on dashboards and wire up acknowledge/override actions as HA buttons.

---

## 8.6 Home Assistant Integration

1) **Add the ESPHome device** in HA (`Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí ESPHome`) using your controller‚Äôs hostname/IP.  
2) **Dashboards**
   - **Annunciator**: tiles for **Any/Group1/2/3**, plus a button for **Ack All**.
   - **Zones**: show **IN1‚Ä¶IN17** grouped by area; add **Relay 1/2/3** toggles for tests.
   - **Service mode**: a helper (boolean) that gates HA from energizing sirens; use **Overrides** sparingly.
3) **Automations**
   - On **Any Alarm ‚Üí ON**: push notification + flash a smart light; if **service_mode = off**, energize **Relay 1** for the siren.
   - On **Group X ‚Üí ON** and **latched**: prompt an **Ack Group X** action.
   - On **Modbus unavailable**: raise a critical alert.

---

## 8.7 Troubleshooting & Tips

- **No data / timeouts**: check **A/B polarity**, shared **COM/GND** (when PSUs differ), and **termination/bias**.  
- **Wrong package vars**: use **`alm_prefix` / `alm_id` / `alm_address`** (not older variable names).  
- **Relays not responding**: verify the relay is **Enabled** in WebConfig and **not overridden**.  
- **Latched alarms won‚Äôt clear**: inputs must be normal **and** you must send the corresponding **Ack**.  
- **Multiple ALMs**: give each a unique **Modbus address** and **`enm_prefix`**.

---

## 8.8 Version & compatibility

- Tested with ESPHome 2025.8.0.
- The controller YAML uses ESP‚ÄëIDF; Arduino also works if preferred (adjust platform accordingly).
