## ⚙️ Features

- 17 opto-isolated digital inputs for dry-contact sensors (motion, door/window, tamper, panic).
- 3 relay outputs (NO/NC) for sirens, lights, electric locks, or other external devices.
- Isolated 12V and 5V power outputs for powering connected sensors directly.
- Status LEDs for all inputs and outputs, with surge and ESD protection.
- USB Type‑C interface for firmware configuration and diagnostics.
- Ships with pre-installed MicroPython firmware and predefined Modbus registers.
- Built on the RP2350A microcontroller; programmable via MicroPython or Arduino IDE.
- Fully integrable with **Home Assistant** via MiniPLC or MicroPLC for automation logic.
